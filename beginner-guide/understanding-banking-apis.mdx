# Understanding Banking APIs

If you're new to programming or banking technology, the term "API" might sound intimidating. Don't worry! By the end of this guide, you'll understand exactly how banking APIs work and why they're essential for modern financial systems.

## What is an API? (In Simple Terms)

Think of an API like a waiter in a restaurant:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="The Restaurant Analogy">
    **You (Customer)** want to order food
    ↓
    **Waiter (API)** takes your order
    ↓
    **Kitchen (Bank System)** prepares your food
    ↓
    **Waiter (API)** brings you the food
    ↓
    **You (Customer)** receive what you ordered
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="The Banking Reality">
    **Your App** wants to check account balance
    ↓
    **Banking API** receives the request
    ↓
    **Bank Database** looks up the balance
    ↓
    **Banking API** returns the balance
    ↓
    **Your App** displays "$1,247.83"
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

**API stands for "Application Programming Interface"** - it's simply a way for different computer programs to talk to each other safely and efficiently.

## Why Banks Need APIs

### The Old Days (Before APIs)
- Banks had isolated systems that couldn't talk to each other
- Customers had to visit physical branches for most transactions
- Each bank built everything from scratch
- Sharing data between systems was manual and error-prone

### Today (With Banking APIs)
- Different systems work together seamlessly
- Customers can bank from anywhere using mobile apps
- Banks can integrate with third-party services easily
- Data flows securely between authorized applications

## Rails Public API Categories

### 1. Account Management APIs 🏦
**Public endpoints for**: Account creation, balance inquiries, and account information

<CodeGroup>
```javascript Get Account Balance
// Request account balance using Rails API
const response = await fetch('https://api.rails.com/v1/accounts/12345/balance', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer your-rails-token',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  }
});

const data = await response.json();
console.log(`Balance: $${data.balance}`);
// Output: Balance: $1,247.83
```

```json Response Example
{
  "account_id": "12345",
  "balance": 1247.83,
  "available_balance": 1200.00,
  "currency": "USD",
  "account_type": "checking",
  "last_updated": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```
</CodeGroup>

### 2. Transaction Processing APIs 💸
**Public endpoints for**: Money transfers, payments, and transaction history

<CodeGroup>
```javascript Transfer Money
// Transfer funds using Rails API
const transferRequest = {
  from_account_id: "acc_alice_123",
  to_account_id: "acc_bob_456", 
  amount: 5000, // Amount in cents (e.g., $50.00)
  currency: "USD",
  description: "Birthday gift",
  idempotency_key: "unique-key-123"
};

const response = await fetch('https://api.rails.com/v1/transfers', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': 'Bearer your-rails-token'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify(transferRequest)
});
```

```json Success Response
{
  "transfer_id": "txf_789xyz",
  "status": "completed",
  "amount": 5000,
  "currency": "USD",
  "from_account_id": "acc_alice_123",
  "to_account_id": "acc_bob_456",
  "completed_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:15Z",
  "fee": 0
}
```
</CodeGroup>

### 3. Customer Management APIs 👤
**Public endpoints for**: Customer onboarding, profile management, and authentication

<CodeGroup>
```javascript Create Customer
// Create a new customer using Rails API
const customerData = {
  first_name: "John",
  last_name: "Doe",
  email: "john.doe@example.com",
  phone: "+1-555-0123",
  date_of_birth: "1990-01-15",
  address: {
    street: "123 Main St",
    city: "Anytown",
    state: "CA",
    zip_code: "90210"
  }
};

const response = await fetch('https://api.rails.com/v1/customers', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': 'Bearer your-rails-api-key'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify(customerData)
});
```

```json Customer Created Response
{
  "customer_id": "cust_abc123",
  "first_name": "John",
  "last_name": "Doe", 
  "email": "john.doe@example.com",
  "status": "active",
  "kyc_status": "pending",
  "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:25:00Z"
}
```
</CodeGroup>

## How Rails APIs Keep Your Money Safe

### 🔐 API Authentication
**Secure access using API keys and tokens**

```javascript
// Rails API authentication methods
const headers = {
  'Authorization': 'Bearer rails_live_key_abc123...',
  'X-Rails-Version': '2024-01-15',
  'Content-Type': 'application/json'
};

// For server-to-server calls
const serverHeaders = {
  'Authorization': 'Bearer rails_secret_key_xyz789...',
  'Content-Type': 'application/json'
};
```

### 🛡️ Scope-Based Permissions
**Each API key has specific permissions**

```json Rails API Scopes
{
  "api_key": "rails_live_key_abc123",
  "scopes": [
    "accounts:read",
    "transfers:create",
    "customers:read",
    "webhooks:receive"
  ],
  "environment": "production",
  "rate_limit": "1000/hour"
}
```

### 🔒 Data Protection
**All data encrypted in transit and at rest**

```javascript
// Rails automatically handles encryption
// HTTPS required for all API calls
const apiUrl = 'https://api.rails.com/v1/accounts'; // Always HTTPS

// Sensitive data is never exposed in responses
{
  "account_id": "acc_safe_id_123",
  "masked_number": "****1234",
  "balance": 1500.00
}
```

## Real-World API Example: Mobile Banking App

Let's trace what happens when you check your balance in a banking app:

<Steps>
  <Step title="You open your banking app">
    **What happens**: App sends authentication request to verify your identity
    ```javascript
    POST /api/auth/login
    { "username": "john_doe", "password": "***" }
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Bank confirms your identity">
    **What happens**: Bank API returns a secure token (like a temporary pass)
    ```json
    { "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs...", "expires_in": 3600 }
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="App requests your account information">
    **What happens**: App uses the token to ask for your accounts
    ```javascript
    GET /api/users/12345/accounts
    Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs...
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Bank API returns your accounts">
    **What happens**: You see your checking and savings accounts
    ```json
    {
      "accounts": [
        { "id": "checking_123", "type": "checking", "balance": 1247.83 },
        { "id": "savings_456", "type": "savings", "balance": 5000.00 }
      ]
    }
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Common API Concepts Explained

### HTTP Methods (The Verbs of APIs)

<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem title="GET - Reading Information">
    **Like asking**: "Can I see my account balance?"
    
    ```javascript
    // GET requests retrieve data without changing anything
    GET /api/accounts/123/balance
    
    // Returns the current balance
    { "balance": 1247.83, "currency": "USD" }
    ```
  </AccordionItem>
  
  <AccordionItem title="POST - Creating Something New">
    **Like saying**: "I want to create a new savings account"
    
    ```javascript
    // POST requests create new resources
    POST /api/accounts
    {
      "type": "savings",
      "initial_deposit": 100.00
    }
    
    // Returns the new account details
    { "account_id": "savings_789", "balance": 100.00 }
    ```
  </AccordionItem>
  
  <AccordionItem title="PUT - Updating Information">
    **Like saying**: "I want to change my phone number"
    
    ```javascript
    // PUT requests update existing resources
    PUT /api/users/123/profile
    {
      "phone": "+1-555-9876"
    }
    
    // Returns confirmation of the update
    { "message": "Profile updated successfully" }
    ```
  </AccordionItem>
  
  <AccordionItem title="DELETE - Removing Something">
    **Like saying**: "I want to close this account"
    
    ```javascript
    // DELETE requests remove resources
    DELETE /api/accounts/456
    
    // Returns confirmation
    { "message": "Account closed successfully" }
    ```
  </AccordionItem>
</Accordion>

## Rails API Documentation

### Interactive API Explorer
**Test APIs directly from the documentation**

Rails provides comprehensive, interactive documentation:

<CodeGroup>
```bash Try API Endpoint
# Example: Create a customer account
curl -X POST https://api.rails.com/v1/customers \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your_api_key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "first_name": "Alice",
    "last_name": "Johnson",
    "email": "alice@example.com",
    "phone": "+1-555-0123"
  }'
```

```json Success Response
{
  "customer_id": "cust_alice_567",
  "first_name": "Alice",
  "last_name": "Johnson",
  "email": "alice@example.com",
  "status": "active",
  "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "kyc_status": "pending"
}
```

```json Error Response
{
  "error": {
    "code": "validation_failed",
    "message": "Email already exists",
    "details": {
      "field": "email",
      "value": "alice@example.com"
    }
  }
}
```
</CodeGroup>

## Testing with Rails APIs

### Sandbox Environment
Rails provides a full sandbox for safe testing without real money:

<CodeGroup>
```javascript Sandbox API Test
// Test account creation in sandbox
const testCustomer = {
  first_name: "Test",
  last_name: "User",
  email: "test@example.com",
  phone: "+1-555-TEST"
};

const response = await fetch('https://api.sandbox.rails.com/v1/customers', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer rails_sandbox_key_test123',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify(testCustomer)
});

const customer = await response.json();
expect(customer.customer_id).toMatch(/^cust_test_/);
```

```javascript Test Transfer
// Test money transfer in sandbox
const testTransfer = {
  from_account_id: 'acc_test_sender',
  to_account_id: 'acc_test_receiver',
  amount: 2500, // $25.00 in cents
  currency: 'USD',
  idempotency_key: 'test_transfer_123'
};

const response = await fetch('https://api.sandbox.rails.com/v1/transfers', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer rails_sandbox_key_test123',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify(testTransfer)
});

const transfer = await response.json();
expect(transfer.status).toBe('completed');
```
</CodeGroup>

## Common Integration Mistakes (And How to Avoid Them)

<Warning>
**Security Mistakes**

## Key Takeaways

<Note>
**Remember These Important Points:**

1. **APIs are messengers** - They carry requests between your app and the bank's systems
2. **Security is paramount** - Banking APIs have multiple layers of protection
3. **Each API has a purpose** - Users, Accounts, and Transactions each handle specific tasks
4. **Documentation is your friend** - Always read the API docs before coding
5. **Test everything** - In banking, accuracy is more important than speed

**Most importantly**: Don't be intimidated! Every developer started as a beginner. Banking APIs are just tools to help you build amazing financial applications.
